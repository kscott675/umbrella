# Umbrella.app

Hi!

This app is pretty straightforward, enter a location to receive its current temp and time. 

You will be asked if you would like to see an hourly report. Type Y or N and then enter to submit your response!

To start, open up a codespace and run this command in the terminal:

    ~ bundle install ; ruby weather.rb

or you can run them separately:

    ~ bundle install

    ~ ruby weather.rb

Happy Forecasting!
